Kinematics Simulation as an NFT and its upload to IPFS using NFT.Storage

We are developing a dapp using NFT.storage that let us export the Physics simulation generated from OP Kinematics as an NFT and upload it to IPFS using NFT.Storage. We are extending NFTUp dapp both for Post PC and PC devices using ionic low code, no code framework and are using OP Calc for tabulation, organization and export of the Kinematics output as an NFT.
