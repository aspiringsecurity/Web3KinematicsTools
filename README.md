# OP Kinematics

Developer tools to enable DeSci educators and Web3 game designers to create a kinematics playground and simulator to develop on-chain educational games -- you can add and create a variety of shapes, and see them come to life with forces (visualize gravity (g), Newton!), friction (scrrape), and inertia (think, slow down!) using Optimism, Lattice's, MUD, 0xPARC and OSS Web3 tools.

We wish to enable constructionist learning by empowering Web3 game developer community and DeSci educators to build educational games and teach concepts in Kinematics including  Newton Laws, acceleration due to gravity, circular motion, rotational motion and projectiles.

Web3 Kinematics experiments to try using OP Kinematics:
- Build a machine that sorts different sized balls in to two buckets, large and small, with no ball jams.
- A cyclic mechanism for lifting balls from the bottom of the screen to the top, again and again.
- Try dropping 2 different mass objects at the same time.
- Experiment with pendulums of different lengths and masses.
- Ping pong, can you make a device that hits a ball back and forth across the screen?
- Convert rotation into parallel motion using pistons.
- Try building a ratchet mechanism.


We are using  using Optimism, Lattice's, MUD, 0xPARC and OSS Web3 tools.

We are developing an on-chain Kinematics engine using PyBox2D library and measuring user analytics on-chain using an OSS spreadsheet on Optimism namely OPCalc. We are using a variety of Web3 tools in Optimism to enable: 

1. Giving free Optimism transactions to DeSci educators sharing lesson plans and game designs for teaching Newton Laws, gravity, circular motion, rotational motion and projectiles.

2. Tracing Optimism transactions to improve user retention and detect, analyze issues in real-time: We are extending Tenderly to trace optimism transactions.
