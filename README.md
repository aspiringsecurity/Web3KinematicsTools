# OP Kinematics ( Project in OP Nodekit Collective)

Developer tools to enable DeSci educators and Web3 game designers to create a kinematics playground and simulator to develop on-chain educational games -- you can add and create a variety of shapes, and see them come to life with forces (visualize gravity (g), Newton!), friction (scrrape), and inertia (think, slow down!) using Optimism, Chainlink VRF, NFT.Storage, Lattice's, MUD, 0xPARC and OSS Web3 tools.

We wish to enable constructionist learning by empowering Web3 game developer community and DeSci educators to build educational games and teach concepts in Kinematics including  Newton Laws, acceleration due to gravity, circular motion, rotational motion and projectiles.

Web3 Kinematics experiments to try using OP Kinematics:
- Build a machine that sorts different sized balls in to two buckets, large and small, with no ball jams.
- A cyclic mechanism for lifting balls from the bottom of the screen to the top, again and again.
- Try dropping 2 different mass objects at the same time.
- Experiment with pendulums of different lengths and masses.
- Ping pong, can you make a device that hits a ball back and forth across the screen?
- Convert rotation into parallel motion using pistons.
- Try building a ratchet mechanism.

# Blockchain Eco-system

We are using  using Optimism, Lattice's MUD, Chainlink VRF, NFT.storage, 0xPARC and OSS Web3 tools.


# OPTIMISM

We are developing an on-chain Kinematics engine using PyBox2D library and measuring user analytics on-chain using an OSS spreadsheet on Optimism namely OPCalc. Details and references on Optimism Usage and Interaction:

a. Web3 Kinematics tools and integration using Optimism MUD starter kit: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/Web3KinematicsTools/tree/main/web3kinematicsdev and https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/Web3KinematicsTools/tree/main/web3kinematicsdev/optimism-mud-dev-tools

b. Optimism based low-code spreadsheet to facilitate measurement of on-chain user analytics and engagement, visualization and leaderboard statistics: We are developing a user analytics and leaderboard template on Optimism based low-code spreadsheet maintained by us for Optimism DeSci projects: please visit https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/Web3KinematicsTools/tree/main/web3kinematicsdev/optimism-calc-analytics-dao 

Future Goals: We wish to use a variety of Web3 tools in Optimism to enable: 

1. Giving free Optimism transactions to DeSci educators sharing lesson plans and game designs for teaching Newton Laws, gravity, circular motion, rotational motion and projectiles.

2. Tracing Optimism transactions to improve user retention and detect, analyze issues in real-time: We are extending Tenderly to trace optimism transactions.


# NFT.Storage

We are developing a dapp using NFT.storage that let us export the Physics simulation generated from OP Kinematics as an NFT and upload it to IPFS using NFT.Storage. We are extending NFTUp dapp both for Post PC and PC devices using ionic low code, no code framework and are using OP Calc for tabulation, organization and export of the Kinematics output as an NFT. Please visit: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/Web3KinematicsTools/tree/main/web3kinematicsdev/Export-as-NFT-upload-to-IPFS-with-NFTStorage


# Lattice's MUD framework on Optimism 

We are learning to extend the Lattice's MUD framework react starter kit and MUD developer toolkit on Optimism to enable key aspects of OP Kinematics development:

- Enable Onchain game development 
- Enable Querying onchain data from the MUD Store
- Integration with Optimism based low-code spreadsheet to facilitate measurement of on-chain user analytics and engagement, visualization and leaderboard statistics, data tabulation and organization.

# User Role and Data Security using 0xPARC 

Learning to Implement of ZKP and User Roles, Data Security using 0xPARC: We are learning to implement Zero Knowledge Proofs using OxPARC's Circom starter in Web3 Kinematics Tools and User Role, Data Security. Please visit https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/Web3KinematicsTools/tree/main/circom-experiments-0xparc-tools

Simulation and Experiments on learning ZKP implications in Web3 Kinematics Tools: We are trying to simulate Zero Knowledge Proofs and learning their security implications using OxPARC's ZkREPL in Web3 Kinematics Tools and User Role Security.
