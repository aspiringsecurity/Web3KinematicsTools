# Implementation of Zero Knowledge Proofs using OxPARC's Circom starter 

We are learning to implement Zero Knowledge Proofs using OxPARC's Circom starter in DeSci projects like Web3 Kinematics Tools and User Role Security. 

1. Compile the circuits
2. Apply the final beacon
3. Output your `wasm` and `zkey` files
4. Generate and output a `Verifier.sol`

## Documentation

See the source projects for full documentation and configuration

## Install

`yarn` to install dependencies

## Development builds

`yarn circom:dev` to build deterministic development circuits.

Further, for debugging purposes, you may wish to inspect the intermediate files. This is possible with the `--debug` flag which the `circom:dev` task enables by default. You'll find them (by default) in `artifacts/circom/`

To build a single circuit during development, you can use the `--circuit` CLI parameter. For example, if you make a change to `hash.circom` and you want to _only_ rebuild that, you can run `yarn circom:dev --circuit hash`.

## Production builds

`yarn circom:prod` for production builds (using `Date.now()` as entropy)
